(can use lots of symbols, but not directions ( ^v<> ) or letters otherwise in use, nor brackets, nor =
if the new key has more than 1 symbol ("Fallable", say) it can be referred to by either its whole name, or its first symbol

there have to be spaces around the =

(can use "or" to match one of several entities, useful for defining rule-based
behaviour in terms of properties of objects rather than the objects directly

you cannot use these ones in the level section, because they do not
refer to any particular set of objects that can be placed. Here's an example:

Fallable = Crate or Player 

)

======
RULES     
======     

(rules are applied in order, as many times as possible each before going to the next - this loops until nothing further is changed)

(player can push single block)
[ >  P | C ] -> [  >  P | > C  ]     

(Sokoban doesn't have an action button, but here's an example of one:
If you press action, you push neighbouring blocks away without moving yourself
[ P * | C ] -> [ P * | C > ]
)

(

can do remote checking, to see if two things coexist *at all with

[ A ] [ B ] -> [ C ] [ D ]

useful for remote switches, inventory (have inventory slots as tiles on the top left of the screen, or whatever)

should i allow different rules matching in different directions?
UP [ A ] DOWN [ B ] ->

optimization : if rule of length one, and no directions matched, don't need to make duplicates
 - can probably just do a sweep and remove duplicate rules
)

(the push arrow only applies to the object to its left (so targets and floors don't get pushed, in this case))

(directions are ^v<> - you can use UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT instead if you really want
if you want to specify that something *not* have a force applied to it, use .
[ A. ] -> [A>]
 )

(Direction-specific oness can be prefaced by any combination of 
UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT HORIZONTAL (=LEFT RIGHT) VERTICAL (=UP DOWN)
for instance, gravity might be

DOWN [ F ] -> [ F> ] ( rules only get applied if they don't already match the target state )
there's also the keyword DIAGONALS (= UPRIGHT, DOWNLEFT, RIGHTUP, &c. - there's no arrow-based shorthand equivalent for these) - these need to be explicitly specified, though, if you don't include directions it's assumed ORTHO ( = UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT) 
)


(after all the available rules are applied, actions ( * ) are discarded, and movements are applied, where possible.  Movements are applied until no more movements can be applied without causing collisions)

==============
WINCONDITIONS
==============

(
One or more of the following forms:
  All X on Y
  Some X on Y  (you can say "Any" if you like instead of "Some", they're identical)
  No X on Y
  No X (shorthand for No X on Background, ditto for the others)

  if there are multiple conditions here, they all must be satisfied
)

All Target on Crate
